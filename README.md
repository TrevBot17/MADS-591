Milestone Project 1: Happiness and Life Expectancy

Exploratory data analysis of the relationship between happiness and life expectancy
By Andre Kleber & Trevor McCalmont

Project Summary

Many governments use country-level data points like GDP, happiness indices, and life expectancy to inform their policy making decisions across several aspects of society. The motivation for this project is to examine how happiness, health and economic factors interact and how those decisions are impacting health outcomes for various countries across the world. In this project we will analyze the links between human happiness and life expectancy using a country happiness dataset from the Gallup World Poll and a country life expectancy dataset from the World Bank. Using these data sources, we believe we can answer questions like ‘Is there a relationship between health and happiness?’
